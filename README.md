### Profit&Lost
Profit&Lost is a fullstack web application developed with React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, designed to simplify personal finance management. It allows users to record and categorize income and expenses, keep detailed tracking of their accounts and financial movements, and generate annual reports for more comprehensive analysis. Additionally, being a Progressive Web App, it can be accessed from any device without installation. Currently, I continue working on new features to optimize the user experience and further improve the platform.
