## About Me

Full Stack Developer passionate about creating digital solutions that solve real problems. My approach combines careful design, clean code, and scalable architecture to deliver products that truly impact business growth.

I work with modern technologies on both frontend and backend, from responsive web applications to robust APIs and complex management systems. My goal is always to understand business needs to build solutions that not only work but drive growth.

Alongside a fullstack partner, I co-founded **BOcode**, a company specialized in custom software development that automates processes, scales with businesses, and generates real results. At BOcode, we create complete digital solutions ranging from custom web applications to management systems (CRM/ERP) and technology consulting.
